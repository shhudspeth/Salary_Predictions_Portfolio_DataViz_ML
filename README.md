# Salary_Predictions_Portfolio_DataViz_ML
Here is a project that showcases Data Visualizations skills and Machine Learning parameter tuning.

The file Salary Prediction Interview Assignment gives an general idea as to the why and purpose of the project. But I have not answered all the questions present in the assignment.

My project takes Salary prediction data, cleans, visualizes, and adds new features using Pandas.

I then do some feature engineering and try out a few learning models to get a low MSE score.

A Gradient Boosting Regressor model got the best fit. I then deploy a script that takes data, trains the model, and takes new data and makes predictions.



## VISUALS
START WITH THE POWERPOINT!

## Installation
Please open the jupyter notebook(ipynb) using Jupyter Notebook. I will also include data in a folder and create a python script at a later time, but have not yet.

## Usage
final_solution.head()

## Support
PLEASE think about giving me feedback on this project. I want to learn and know I can do better! Suggestions and comments are more than welcome.

## Roadmap
I hope to improve my interactivity skills in matplotlib soon and add some more EDA features and even solution features of interactive graphs and visualizations.

## Contributing
TBD
